ALPHA release!!!

LOAX is a library for serializing GLES2 commands via TCP that can be rendered
on a LOAX server. This mechanism solves a fundamental limitation of
Linux-on-Android which does not support native graphics. This approach is not
without downsides as it does require more CPU overhead to transmit the GL
commands via TCP and some commands such as glReadPixels will be much slower.
The CPU overhead for Gears increased from ~12% to ~25% on the Nexus 10.

Partially Supported:

* glShaderSource
* glVertexAttribPointer

Unsupported:

* glCompressedTexImage2D
* glCompressedTexSubImage2D
* glGetString
* glGetUniformfv
* glGetUniformiv
* glGetVertexAttribPointerv
* glShaderBinary

Support for event handling is also planned for keyboard, touchscreen, audio,
camera and sensors.
